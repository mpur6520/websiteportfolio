      <h2>PYTHON ANIMATION</h2>
      <p>Using Python and the knowledge of loops, an animation was made by creating different shapes and moving them at different speeds along the x and y axes. The final product was meant to tell a story, having a motif and a thematic message.</p>
      <p>The project I made was based on the quote “there’s a light at the end of every tunnel” by Ada Adams. It’s an animation featuring a frog-shaped car moving through the street, finally reaching a bridge where a sunset can be seen—I’m proud of myself for this concept and even if coding houses’ animation was difficult, I’m pleasantly surprised by the end result. I’ll refer to this when considering things I did right and wrong in retrospect to the animating and creation process.</p>
