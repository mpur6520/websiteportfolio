      <h2>LAB 1: COLORED DOTS</h2>
      <p>Using a combination of web development knowledge as well as Python, the end goal was to create a website where when the mouse was hovered over a specific box, colored dots would begin to flash on the screen. Through this, the user would be able to move their mouse and draw things, the colored dots alternating as the cursor moved.</p>
      <p>It was hard to get a general understanding of how the program was meant to work, but I’m proud of myself for retaining the information regarding web development from a year prior. I was pleasantly surprised at how well the colors I chose worked together, I’ll most likely refer back to this project when creating user-interactive projects.</p>
