    <h2>THINGS ABOUT ME ★☆★☆</h2>
    <p> Hello again! My name is Maru and I currently attend Thomas A. Edison CTE High School as a junior. Currently in the Programming and Prototyping course and having taken Web and App Development the previous year, I hope to extend the knowledge I've gained and use these skills enough to eventually land me a career or long-term job relating to computer science.</p>
