      <h2>PROJECT 4: DIVISIBLE BY 3</h2>
      <p>The user should input a round of 7 numbers, all of which the program checks individually and noting if they could be divided by there. It would then tell the user and display an overall amount of numbers that were divisible by 3 as opposed to not, showing how mathematical expressions and ideas can be made easier through coding.</p>
      <p>The  difficult part was getting the syntax right because the grading was very strict—other than this however at this point it’s become intuitive for me, I was surprised at how easily I’ve completed the assignment. Sometimes I may refer back to this when projects regarding calculation and different mathematical operations come up.</p>
