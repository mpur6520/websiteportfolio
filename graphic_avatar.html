      <h2>PYTHON GRAPHIC AVATAR</h2>
      <p>Using Python, an avatar was created through using different shapes in different places, overlapping them to create a final cohesive product. The end result was a graphic resembling an icon, with some kind of figure on the inside.</p>
      <p>The inspiration behind my project were stylized icons. Originally I had a different design for landscape, but the project guidelines were changed and it was difficult to adapt, though I eventually did. I gained experience in how overlapping shapes can be used to make graphics and will most likely refer to this when I need guidance. Something that surprised me was how intuitive CMUgraphics was, I was able to make my avatar without much trouble.</p>
