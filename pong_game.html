      <h2>PING PONG GAME</h2>
      <p>To get an understanding of what Python is able to do, the goal was to create a functioning ping pong game using the programming language. The end product should have the main components of a ping pong game that work together coherently to provide a pleasant user experience.</p>
      <p>The inspiration behind this was a ping pong game, although it was difficult to replicate one as I barely had any idea of how Python worked at the time—overall I was proud of how the product turned out, it was as functional as I understood to make it and especially my debugging process was good.  The end product surprised me, because it was playable and complete—this was the first time I completed a game.</p>
